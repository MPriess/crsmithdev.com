    "Although I originally went to school and left with a degree for something else (psychology), and then went to work in an unrelated field "
    "(video engineering), I nonetheless found myself burning through a 3-year dash to finish two CS degrees and soak up as much as I could "
    "about software development.  I had been brought there by a deep dissatisfaction with what I was doing with myself in life, and "
    "the spark of passions of my younger self awakened by the first, tentative steps back into programming in well over a decade.  I took on "
    "elaborate projects, published papers, and built software to assist teaching CS courses.  Soon I was cutting my teeth on APIs, web apps and "
    "sentiment analysis at " [:a {:href "http://gremln.com"} "Gremln"] ", at first from a cramped table at Starbucks, then at the first startup "
    "incubator in St. Louis."]

    "A fundraising trip brought me to San Francisco and Silicon Valley, an experience that instantly impressed on me that coming here was clearly "
    "my next step.  Barely two months later, I towed a small trailer across the US to San Francisco, finding a small apartment at the "
    "edge of the Tenderloin, and a small, sharp team of colleagues at " [:a {:href "http://cir.ca"} "Circa"] ".  My professional pursuits have "
    "led me more deeply into open-source development, architecture, distributed systems and functional programming; my living here has placed me "
    "in one of the focal points of an emerging clash of technologies, ideas and cultures whose effects are only beginning to felt around the world."]
   [:p
    "I'm a fan of both good and awful science-fiction and horror in all forms, still very much a student of psychology, a fan of electronic music, "
    "RPG and strategy games, cycling, and may have already lost the ability to thrive outside of places like this.  I also endeavor to always be "
    "working on something interesting, or reading about and trying something new with software."]
