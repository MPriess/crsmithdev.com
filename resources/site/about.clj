   [:p
    "Although I originally went to school and studied psychology, and then worked in the far-removed field of video engineering, "
    "I nonetheless found myself speeding through a 3-year dash to finish two CS degrees and soak up everything I possibly could about "
    "software development.  I had been brought there by a long-building dissatisfaction in what I had done with my life so far, "
    "and passions of my younger self re-ignited by my first, tentative steps back into programming in well over a decade. "]
   [:p
    "That passion served me well &mdash; I took on elaborate projects, published papers, and built software to assist teaching CS courses. "
    "Even before graduating, I was cutting my teeth on APIs, web apps and sentiment analysis at social media startup "
    [:a {:href "http://gremln.com"} "Gremln"] ", at first from a cramped table at Starbucks, then at the first startup incubator in St. Louis."]
   [:p
    "A fundraising trip brought me to San Francisco and Silicon Valley, and with that the clear impression that moving here was my only next step. "
    "Barely two months later, I drove across the US to San Francisco, finding an apartment at the edge of the Tenderloin, and a small, sharp team "
    "of colleagues at " [:a {:href "http://cir.ca"} "Circa"] "."]
   [:p
    "My professional pursuits have since led me more deeply into open-source development, architecture, distributed systems and functional programming; "
    "my life here has placed me in one of the focal points of an emerging collision of technologies, ideas and cultures whose effects are only "
    "just beginning to be felt around the world."]
   [:p
    "I can usually be found watching or reading or reading science-fiction and horror, listening to electronic music, playing RPG and strategy games, "
    "or just cycling around and beyond the city.  But always, I'm hacking away at a project or otherwise learning about something new in tech."]
